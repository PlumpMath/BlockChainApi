to host manually with iisexpress do the following in the command:

iisexpress /config:"C:\Users\Soren\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Projects\BlockChainApi\.vs\config\applicationhost.config" /site:BlockChainApi

the trick is that viusal studio 2015+ puts the config file in a hidden subfolder .vs, thats why the site didnt show up in the iisexpress applicationhost.config file! sneaky. 

After you host it like the above, then you can run it in debug with vs as well, just use another port and create virutal directory, then you have one running through vs and the other hosted individually
with iisexpress, then you should be able to register one with the other and test the consensus algorithm 


think we need to rebuild and publish in order for the iisexpress command line to fetch the correct version? not sure if publish is needed, since we point to root of project, not the folder. 

TODO:

-The mine endpoint is kinda silly - for a realistic PoW algortihm, the get would timeout every time (it would take several hours if not days to mine).
	-The solution would be to have a poll endpoint, and return a poll url in a mine request. Then when u hit the poll url, it tells you status. then once its done, it returns the mine confirmation.
	-or you could also combine it with a callback url where you would post the mine result to. Just to make it async and not timeout. For the toy example here it suffices though with the current setup,
	but the other stuff could be interesting exercise as well.
